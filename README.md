Linear Search- https://github.com/saad1504/Algorithms/blob/master/linear_search.cpp
               Simplest approach for searching for an element in an array
	       Works for sorted and unsorted arrays 
	       Time complexity-O(n),where n is no. of elements
Binary Search- https://github.com/saad1504/Algorithms/blob/master/binary_search.cpp
               More advanced approach to searching for an element in an array
	       Works only for sorted arrays
	       Time complexity-O(log(n)),where n is no. of elements
