Linear Search-  Simplest approach for searching for an element in an array
				Works for sorted and unsorted arrays 
				Time complexity-O(n),where n is no. of elements
Binary Search-  More advanced approach to searching for an element in an array
				Works only for sorted arrays
				Time complexity-O(log(n)),where n is no. of elements
